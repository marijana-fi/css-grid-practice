			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Opened in 1937,</b> the bridge was built at a cost of $35
				million in principal and $39 million in interest and 11 workersâ€™
				lives. The single-suspension span is anchored by twin towers
				that reach skyward 746 feet, and was once taller than any
				building in San Francisco.
			</p>

			<p>
				To support the suspended roadway, two cables, each more than
				7,000 feet in length and both containing 80,000 miles of wire
				stretch over the top of the towers and are rooted in concrete
				anchorages on shore.
